# Clothing waste app

## About this app
The purpose of this app is to encourage users to trade their own second-hand clothes with others to reduce the amount of clothes getting sent to the landfills or ending up in our waterways. I initiated this project to try and tackle the global climate change issue. This project is currently in the prototyping stage. 

## Outcomes
From this project, I learnt how to make a full-stack, cross-platform mobile app using the Flutter SDK and learnt the basics of Android development. I also learnt how to apply the CRUD operations and manipulate data to and from Google's Firestore database.
